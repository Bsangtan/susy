See susy/README for the real README!

Top-level directories mostly follow the MILC layout:
generic   -- Procedures common to most applications: communications, I/O, data layout, etc.
include   -- Header files for common procedures
libraries -- Single processor linear algebra routines
susy      -- Two-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory (under development)
