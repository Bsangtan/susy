# Makefile for Libraries for QCD programs
#
# Library routines involve no communication, so are compiled
# as for a scalar processor.

# The specialized Makefiles are for processors for which we
# have some assembly coded substitutes.
#
# This Makefile builds the purely C coded versions and should work
# for all architectures with a suitable choice of CFLAGS and 
# CC below

# The FAST option uses "fast" variants of the code, where available, and is 
# recommended.  The fast variants are C-coded with explicit loop unrolling
# and inlining.

# The SHORT32 option is required on machines with 64-bit int's
