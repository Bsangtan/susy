This directory of SUSY LATTICE contains parallel code for RHMC simulations of N=4 supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory in four dimensions, including related measurements.

See susy/README for the real README!

Top-level directories mostly follow the MILC layout:
generic   -- Procedures common to most applications: communications, I/O, data layout, etc.
include   -- Header files for common procedures
libraries -- Single processor linear algebra routines
susy      -- RHMC and measurements

Dependences:
Measurements involving polar-projected matrices require LAPACK
Eigenvalue measurements require PRIMME and LAPACK
