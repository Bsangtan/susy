SUSY LATTICE is parallel code for RHMC simulations of N=4 supersymmetric
Yang--Mills theory in four dimensions, and related measurements. Historically
based on the MILC code, this package supersedes the serial C++ code presented
in arXiv:1108.1503.

See susy/README for the real README!

Top-level directories mostly follow the MILC layout:
generic   -- Procedures common to most applications: communications, I/O, data layout, etc.
include   -- Header files for common procedures
libraries -- Single processor linear algebra routines
susy      -- Four-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory: HMC and various measurements (many under development)
