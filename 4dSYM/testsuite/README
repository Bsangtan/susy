This directory provides a suite of tests for the SUSY LATTICE code to simulate four-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory.

Reference input and output files are provided for the following compilation targets (which are described in ../susy/README):
susy_hmc
susy_stout
susy_corr
susy_bilin
susy_hmc_corr
susy_eig
susy_phase

Every target may be tested for U(N) gauge theory with N=2, 3 or 4 colors.  The gauge configurations loaded by each test are also provided.  The susy_phase target is tested with and without checkpointing.

The scripts scalar/run_tests and mpi/run_tests automate the process of compiling, running and checking the given target for the given gauge group.  Each script must be run from its respective directory.  Given the two arguments
$ ./run_tests <N> <tag>
the script will compile the target susy_$tag for gauge group U($N), run the susy_$tag executable using the appropriate input file in this directory, save the output to $tag.U$N.out and check for differences between this output and the reference file $tag.U$N.ref.

Currently the MPI tests are customized for the HET beowulf cluster at the University of Colorado.  Compilation and comparison with the reference files may need to be adjusted for other systems.

Alternately, if run_tests is run with no arguments it will test every target for every N=2, 3 and 4.  This may take some time to complete!
